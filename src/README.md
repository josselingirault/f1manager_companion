# F1-Manager-2022-SaveFile-Repacker
Python script for unpacking the SQLite3 Database from the F1 Manager 2022 savefile and repacking it later with your changes

The save file itself stores around 3KB of metadata (which is stored by the script in "chunk1") and 3 Database files (zlib compressed): main database and two backups of it.
Backup databases may be not present in fresh careers, so don't panic if you don't have them.

Focus on editing the main database :)

# Requirements

- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) to be able to edit the database (or alternative of your liking)
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed to be able to execute the script

If you don't have/don't want to install python then you can try the compiled exe from [Releases](https://github.com/xAranaktu/F1-Manager-2022-SaveFile-Repacker/releases)

# Save Files Location

F1 Manager 2022 save files are stored in:

`C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\F1Manager22\Saved\SaveGames`

# Safety First

The changes you made or bug in script may break your game save.
So, before you start editing anything I strongly recommend to make backup of the game save you want to edit (simply by copying the file somewhere else, i.e to `backup` folder)


# Unpacking

1. Copy the save file you want to edit to directory with the python script (I usually use the autosaves)

2. Run command line ([For newbies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE9WgNr3OjM)) and change directory to the folder with script

3. I've the script in `C:\Users\Aranaktu\Desktop\F1 Manager\SaveFileRepacker`, so the command will be `cd "C:\Users\Aranaktu\Desktop\F1 Manager\SaveFileRepacker"`

4. Unpack the database from save file to "result" folder by executing script

Depending on your installation, `python` may not work, then try `python3` instead

`python script.py --operation unpack --input autosave.sav --result result`

5. Now you should have 4 files in "result" dir

# Editing Database

Baiscally, you need to:
1. Run `DB Browser for SQLite`
2. File -> Open Database (CTRL + O)
3. Open `main.db` that you should have in `SaveFileRepacker\result`
4. Edit the tables you want.
5. Once done make sure you `Write Changes` & `Close Database`
6. Close `DB Browser for SQLite`

Now, you are ready for repacking

# Repacking

Repacking operation will take files from `result` folder and pack it into savefile that game can load.

1. Run command line and change directory to the folder with script and `result` folder
2. Execute the script

`python script.py --operation repack --input result --result autosave.sav`

Command above will take files from `result` and store them in `autosave.sav`, next to the script. This will ofc. overwrite the file you have copied previously from your SaveGames directory

3. Once you have the new save file ready, copy it to F1 Manager SaveGames folder to make it visible by the game. (Ovewrwrite if asked to)

4. Finally, you can load the save in-game (auto save if you followed this example) and enjoy your changes
